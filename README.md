# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python with Tkinter for the GUI. The game features a snake that grows in size as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game window.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the game using Python:


## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
- The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's body or the boundaries of the game window.
- Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer, and your score will increase.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
- After the game ends, you can restart by closing the game window and running `python main.py` again.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
